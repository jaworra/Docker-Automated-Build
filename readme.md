# Automated Docker builds
- CI/CD pipeline, build new docker from GitHub into DockHub. 

# ToDo:
-Invoke WebHooks. WebHooks are useful for notifying services using the image that a new image has been deployed. To use a WebHook, there needs to be an endpoint to call. AWS provides many ways to do this, what happens after the the build completes and the WebHook is called will vary.
