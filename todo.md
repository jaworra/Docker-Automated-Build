# List of To-Dos

## CI/CD

- [ ] github actions
- [ ] CD, Invoke WebHooks, useful for notifying services using the image that a new image has been deployed.
      To use a WebHook, there needs to be an endpoint to call. AWS provides many ways to do this, what happens after the the build completes and the WebHook is called will vary.
- [x] CI, with docker hub
